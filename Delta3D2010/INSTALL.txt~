Installing Instructions
==========================
You can build this package using CMake build system (version 2.6 or higher
should be installed on your system). CMake can generate different kinds of
native build files for your system (e.g. Unix Makefiles, Eclipse CDT 4.0 project
files, Visual Studio project files). You can generate build files using CMake
command-line or GUI interfaces.

Requirements
============
CMake version 2.6 or higher
C++ compiler 
C/C++ IDE

Making Binary  Using CMake Command-line Interface (Step by Step) 
===========
1. Unpack the distribution and change directory to the top level source tree.
2. (Recommended) Create a directory to hold your build files (e.g. 'mkdir build')
3. Change directory to the directory you created in the previous step (for the
   above example, you can use 'cd build')
4. Run 'cmake ..' to configure the package and generate build files. On Linux,
   it'll generate Makefiles for the package
5. Optionally, you can run 'ccmake .' to edit the build settings (for example
   the installation directory).
6. Considering that you've generated Makefiles using cmake, you can run 'make'
   to build the package.
