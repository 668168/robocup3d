The files for this library have been taken from the rcssbase package
(9.4.5) that can be found in the soccer server 
repository (www.sf.net/projects/sserver). 

Additionally, some files have been added to complete the library. This
code has been ripped from the rcssbase library so that rcssserver3D
users don't need to install so many libraries. Some features were
missing (like a tcpsocket), which also could have been added to rcssbase. 
This way was easier for us (and probably also for most of the users).
