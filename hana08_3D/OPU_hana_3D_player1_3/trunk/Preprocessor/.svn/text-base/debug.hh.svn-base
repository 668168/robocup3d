///\brief Preprosessor macro's for easy debug info printing
///
///These preprosessor instructions place info as debugging information on the screen.
///You should use DEBUGLEVEL to set the level of debugging info you want. When DEBUGLEVEL is not defined
/// these macro's evaluate to nothing.
///
///If DEBUGLEVEL is set to 1, Level1 debug info is printed. If DEBUGLEVEL is set to 2, all Level2 and lower are printed. etc.
///
///Which level you use for what is totally your choice, but I try to use this:
///1. Current debugging problems ONLY
///2. Single run messages (initialization etc.)
///3. General messages
///4. Messages inside loops and large messages (common)
///5. Messages inside multiple loops or very large
///
///To set the debuglevel of a class, place \#define DEBUGLEVEL in the internal header file (in contrast to the header). This will keep multiple defenitions from occuring when compiling.
///
///The output generated is: "[Filename]:[Line number]: [information]\n"
///
///The extraction operator is used for creating the debug line, so info can contain more then multiple elements devided
/// by extraction operators.
///\section examples Examples
///\code
/// _debugLevel2("Starting algorithm with:" << "something.");
/// _debugLevel3("And thinking about running it" << i << " times.");
///\endcode
///NEW: FLUSHING HAS BEEN DISABLED, ENABLE FOR SEGFAULT DEBUGGING
///NEW: NO_DEBUG WILL DISABLE ALL DEBUG STATEMENTS, DEFINE IT WITH THE g++ ARGUMENTS
//No include guards, to keep the defenitions as much up to date as possible, due to the dependencie on DEBUGLEVEL.
