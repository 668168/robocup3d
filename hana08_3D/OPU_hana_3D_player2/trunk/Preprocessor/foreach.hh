// The triple expansion may seem daring, but it is needed to fully expand the __LINE__
// Which is needed for code like: foreach(iter, arrayOfVectors[0])

///\brief Preprosessor macro to define a STL iterator for loop: _foreach(iterator, container)
///
///The preprosessor instruction foreach takes a variable name and an iterator name and translates
///into a default for loop using the != operator. It should work with any forward iterator.
///For const iterators, there is the cforeach preprocessor macro.
///\section examples Examples
///\code
///vector<usnigned> numbers;
///numbers.push_back(10);
///_foreach(number, numbers)
///  cout << *number << "\n";
///\endcode
///
///DON'T!!!
///Don't use temporary const objects returned by functions, like: foreach(i, file.lines()).

#error _foreach already defined! This macro may have gone wild!

#define _foreach( iter, cont) for( __typeof__((cont).begin()) iter = (cont).begin(); iter != (cont).end(); ++iter)
